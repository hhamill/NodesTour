NodesTour
=========
This is a little sample java application that performs a classic knights tour, using a linked list as the board.
It was built in netbeans for mac, in case that helps; although I'm not sure how portable the project files themselves are.

In case the project fails you, the application can be found in the src folder and consists of 4 java class files, with NodesTour.java being the main application, and the others supporting.

The Main() function of the application currently runs the process and outputs the result to console; 
but the classes are abstracted so that the result could potentially be drawn or used otherwise later.
