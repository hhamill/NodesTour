NodesTour
=========
This is a little sample java application that performs a classic knights tour, using a linked list as the board.
It was built in netbeans, in case that helps.

The Main() function of the application currently runs the process and outputs the result to console; 
but the classes are abstracted so that the result could potentially be drawn or used otherwise later.
